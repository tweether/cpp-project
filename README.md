This is a template to setting up a new C++ project, usually create a new C++ project requires a significant amount of preparation and boilerplate code, even more so for modern C++ projects with tests, executables and continuous integration. This template should help reduce the work required to setup up a modern C++ project.

## Features

- Sources, headers and mains separated in distinct folders
- Use of modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for much easier compiling
- Automatic [google code style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) check
- Integrated test suite using [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Code coverage reports, including automatic upload to [codecov.io](codecov.io)
- Setup for static code analysis using [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/)
- Continuous integration via [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) / [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com)
- Support [Conan](https://conan.io/) package manager to quick install your package
- Moderm github issues template
- Suited for single header libraries and projects of any scale

## Usage

### Setup

When starting a new project, you probably don't want the history of this repository. To start fresh you can use the setup script as follows:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/tweether/cpp-project && cd cpp-project
$ ./setup.sh
```

### Building

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run cmake in that dir, and then use make to build the desired target.

```shell
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
```

## Learning

GameMesh has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://cpp-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

#### Built-in server

A quick documention to install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation).

```shell
$ mkdocs serve
```

Open up `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser, and you'll see the document home page being displayed.
